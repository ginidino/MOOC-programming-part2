# Exercise 36: Greeter
Implement a user interface which displays the text "Hi!". The width of the user interface (i.e. of the JFrame object) has to be at least 400px, its height 200px, and its title should be "Swing on". The JFrame object should be created and become visible inside the method `run()`, and the text components are added to the user interface with the method `createComponents(Container container)`.

> ATTENTION: The ui object variables have to be initiated in the methods or in the constructor! Do not initiate an object variable directly in its definition.
