# Exercise 37: Survey
Use `BoxLayout` as layout manager for your user interface; the components are the classes `JLabel`, `JRadioButton`, `JCheckBox` and `JButton`.

Use the class `ButtonGroup` to make sure the options `"No reason."` and `"Because it is fun!"` cannot be chosen at the same time.

Make sure that the user interface is big enough so that the user can click the buttons without resizing the interface. For instance, you can use 200 pixels for the width and 300 pixels for the height.
