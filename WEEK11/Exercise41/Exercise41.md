# Exercise 41: Drawing Board
With the exercise body, you find a pre-made user interface, which is connected to the class DrawingBoard, which inherits JPanel. Modify the method `paintCOmponent` of `DrawingBoard`. You can only use the `fillRect` method of the graphics object, in this exercise.

> Attention! Do not use more than five `fillRect` calls. The figure does not have to be identical to the one above, the tests tell you when your figure is close enough to the required one.
