# Exercise 3 is about Calculator

> In this assignment, we make a simple calculator, similar to the one made in the material of programming basics' week 1. This time however, we pay attention to the structure of the program. Especially we will make the main-method (the main program) very light. The main program method doesn't actually do anything else than just start the program:
```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
            calculator.start();
        }
    }
```       
> What the main program here does is it just creates the object that implements the actual application logic and then starts it. This is the proper way of creating programs and from now on we'll try to achieve this structure.

## Exercise 3.1 is about Reader
> In order to communicate with the user, the calculator needs a Scanner-object. As we've seen, reading integers with a Scanner is a little laborious. We now create a separate class Reader that encapsulates a Scanner-object.

> Implement the class Reader and add the following methods to it   
    public String readString()      
    public int readInteger()      

> Within the Reader there should be a Scanner-object as an instance variable, which the methods use in the old familiar way we know from programming basics. Remember that when reading integers, it's good to first read the entire line and then turn that in to an integer. Here we can utilize the method parseInt of the Integer-class.

## Exercise 3.2 is about Application body
> The calculator works like this:
```
    command: sum
    value1: 4
    value2: 6
    sum of the values 10

    command: product
    value1: 3
    value2: 2
    product of the values 6

    command: end
```
> Implement the class Calculator to take care of the application logic of your program, and for that class a method public void start() which looks exactly like this:
```java   
     public void start() {
         while (true) {
             System.out.print("command: ");
             String command = reader.readString();
             if (command.equals("end")) {
                 break;
             }

             if (command.equals("sum")) {
                 sum();
             } else if (command.equals("difference")) {
                 difference();
             } else if (command.equals("product")) {
                 product();
             }
         }
         statistics();
     }
```
> The calculator has the operations sum, difference, product.   
> Finish the bodies for the methods sum, difference, product and stasistics. All of them are to be of the type private void which means that the methods are available only for internal use in the calculator.   
> Add an instance variable of the type Reader for the calculator and create the reader in the constructor. The calculator may not have a separate Scanner-type variable!

## Exercise 3.3 is about Implementation of the application logic
> Now implement the methods sum, difference and product so that they work according to the example above. In the example, first a command is asked from the user and then two values. The desired operation is then executed and the value of the operation is printed.Notice that asking the user for the values happens within the methods sum, difference and product! The methods use the Reader-object to ask the values, so the body of the methods is as follows:
```java    
    private void sum() {
       System.out.print("value1: ");
       int value1 = // read the value using the Reader-object
       System.out.print("value2: ");
       int value2 = // read the value using the Reader-object
       // print the value according to the example above
    }
```        
## Exercise 3.4 is about Statistics
> After the while-loop in the start-method, the method statistics is called. The method is meant to print the amount of operations done with the Calculator-object:
```
    command: sum
    value1: 4
    value2: 6
    sum of the values 10

    command: product
    value1: 3
    value2: 2
    product of the values 6

    command: end
    Calculations done 2
```
> Implement the method private void statistics(), and make the required changes to the code of the Calculator-class in order to collect the statistics.   

> Note   
    if an invalid command is given to the program (something other than sum, difference, product or end), the calculator will not react to the command in any way, but instead continues by asking the next command. Statistics is not to count an invalid command as a completed calculation.
```
    command: integral
    command: difference
    value1: 3
    value2: 2
    difference of the values 1

    command: end
    Calculations done 1
```
> Bonus assignment (not tested):    
    Reading the user input is repeated in the same way in all three operation implementing methods. Remove the repetition from your code with the help of a support method. The method can return the two values asked from the user in an array, for example.
