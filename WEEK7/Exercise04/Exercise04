Exercise04 is about Thing, Suitcase, and Container and is divided into 8 part
  * In these exercises, we create the classes Thing, Suitcase, and Container, and we train to use objects which contain other objects.

Exercise 4.1 is about Class Thing
  * Create the class Thing whose objects can represent different kinds of things. The information to store are the thing's name and weight (kg).

  * Add the following methods to your class:
    - A construsctor, which is given the thing's name and weight as parameter
    - public String getName(), which returns the thing's name
    - public int getWeight(), which returns the thing's weight
    - public String toString(), which returns a string in the form "name (weight kg)"

  * Below, you find an example of how to use the class:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thing book = new Thing("Happiness in Three Steps", 2);
            Thing mobile = new Thing("Nokia 3210", 1);

            System.out.println("Book name: " + book.getName());
            System.out.println("Book weight: " + book.getWeight());

            System.out.println("Book: " + book);
            System.out.println("Mobile: " + mobile);
        }
    }
        
  * The program output should look like the following:
    Book name: Happiness in Three Steps
    Book weight: 2
    Book: Happiness in Three Steps (2 kg)
    Mobile: Nokia 3210 (1 kg)
    
Exercise 4.2 is about Class Suitcase
 * Create the class Suitcase. Suitcase has things and a maximum weight limit, which defines the greatest total allowed weight of the things contained within the Suitcase object.

 * Add the following methods to your class:
   - A constructor, which is given a maximum weight limit
   - public void addThing(Thing thing), which adds the thing in the parameter to your suitcase. The method does not return any value.
   - public String toString(), which returns a string in the form "x things (y kg)"

  * The things are saved into an ArrayList object:

   ArrayList<Thing> things = new ArrayList<Thing>();
            
  * The class Suitcase has to make sure the thing's weight does not cause the total weight to exceed the maximum weight limit. 
    The method addThing should not add a new thing if the total weight happens to exceed the maximum weight limit.

  * Below, you find an example of how the class can be used:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thing book = new Thing("Happiness in three steps", 2);
            Thing mobile = new Thing("Nokia 3210", 1);
            Thing brick = new Thing("Brick", 4);

            Suitcase suitcase = new Suitcase(5);
            System.out.println(suitcase);

            suitcase.addThing(book);
            System.out.println(suitcase);

            suitcase.addThing(mobile);
            System.out.println(suitcase);

            suitcase.addThing(brick);
            System.out.println(suitcase);
        }
    }
            
  * The program output should look like the following:
    0 things (0 kg)
    1 things (2 kg)
    2 things (3 kg)
    2 things (3 kg)
            
Exercise 4.3 is about Language Check
  * "0 things" or "1 things" is not really proper English â€“ it would be better to say "empty" or "1 thing". 
     Implement this change in the class Suitcase.

  * Now, the output of the previous program should look like the following:
    empty (0 kg)
    1 thing (2 kg)
    2 things (3 kg)
    2 things (3 kg)
            
Exercise 4.4 is about Every Thing
  * Add the following methods to Suitcase:
    - printThings, which prints out all the things inside the suitcase
    - totalWeight, which returns the total weight of the things in your suitcase

  * Below, there is an example of how the class can be used:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thing book = new Thing("Happiness in Three Steps", 2);
            Thing mobile = new Thing("Nokia 3210", 1);
            Thing brick = new Thing("Brick", 4);

            Suitcase suitcase = new Suitcase(10);
            suitcase.addThing(book);
            suitcase.addThing(mobile);
            suitcase.addThing(brick);

            System.out.println("Your suitcase contains the following things:");
            suitcase.printThings();
            System.out.println("Total weight: " + suitcase.totalWeight() + " kg");
        }
    }
            
  * The program output should now look like the following:
    Your suitcase contains the following things:
    Happiness in Three Steps (2 kg)
    Nokia 3210 (1 kg)
    Brick (4 kg)
    Total weight: 7 kg
