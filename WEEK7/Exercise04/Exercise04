Exercise04 is about Thing, Suitcase, and Container and is divided into 8 part
  * In these exercises, we create the classes Thing, Suitcase, and Container, and we train to use objects which contain other objects.

Exercise 4.1 is about Class Thing
  * Create the class Thing whose objects can represent different kinds of things. The information to store are the thing's name and weight (kg).

  * Add the following methods to your class:
    - A construsctor, which is given the thing's name and weight as parameter
    - public String getName(), which returns the thing's name
    - public int getWeight(), which returns the thing's weight
    - public String toString(), which returns a string in the form "name (weight kg)"

  * Below, you find an example of how to use the class:

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thing book = new Thing("Happiness in Three Steps", 2);
            Thing mobile = new Thing("Nokia 3210", 1);

            System.out.println("Book name: " + book.getName());
            System.out.println("Book weight: " + book.getWeight());

            System.out.println("Book: " + book);
            System.out.println("Mobile: " + mobile);
        }
    }
        
  * The program output should look like the following:
    Book name: Happiness in Three Steps
    Book weight: 2
    Book: Happiness in Three Steps (2 kg)
    Mobile: Nokia 3210 (1 kg)
