Exercise 10 is about NationalService and is divided into 2 part
  * In the exercise layout, you find the premade interface NationalService, which contains the following operations:
    - the method int getDaysLeft() which returns the number of days left on service
    - the method void work(), which reduces the working days by one. The working days number can not become negative.

    public interface NationalService {
        int getDaysLeft();
        void work();
    }
                
Exercise 10.1 is about CivilService
  * Create the class CivilService which implements your NationalService interface. 
    The class constructor is without parameter. 
    The class has the object variable daysLeft which is initialised in the constructor receiving the value 362.

Exercise 10.2 is about MilitaryService
  * Create the class MilitaryService which implements your NationalService interface. 
    The class constructor has one parameter, defining the days of service (int daysLeft).
