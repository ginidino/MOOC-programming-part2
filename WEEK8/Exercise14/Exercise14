Exercise 14 is about Students Sorted by Name

  * You find the pre-made class Student. Students have got a name. 
    Make Student implement the COmparable interface, so that the compareTo method would sort the students in alphabetic order.

  * Tip: student names are Strings, the class String is Comparable itself. 
    You can use the String's compareTo method when you implement your Student class. 
    String.compareTo gives a different value to characters according to their case; 
    because of this, String has also got the method compareToIgnoreCase which, in fact, ignores the case while comparing. 
    You can use either of them, when you sort your students.
