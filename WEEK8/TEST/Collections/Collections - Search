Collections
The class library Collections is Java's general-purpose library for collection classes. 
As we can see, Collections provides methods to sort objects either through the interface Comparable or Comparator. 
In addition to sorting, we can use this class library to retrieve the minimum and maximum values (through the methods min and max, respectively), 
retrieve a specific value (binarySearch method), or reverse the list (reverse method).

Search
The Collections class library provides a pre-made binary search functionality. 
The method binarySearch() returns the index of our searched key, if this is found. 
If the key is not found, the search algorithm returns a negative value. 
The method binarySearch() makes use of the Comparable interface to retieve objects. 
If the object's compareTo() method returns the value 0, i.e. if it is the same object, the key is considered found.


Notice the method Collections.sort()
  This is because binary search cannot be done if our table or list are not already sorted up.
